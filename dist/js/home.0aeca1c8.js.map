Por\r\n            exemplo, se as apostas forem 10-200000, a taxa de bônus\r\n            correspondente será 15/10000, e se as apostas forem superiores a\r\n            3000000, o bônus de agente é 15/10000. A é o agente do website, ele\r\n            recruta B1, B2 e B3 como seus agentes e B1 também recruta C1 e C2\r\n            como seus agentes. B2 não tem agentes e B3 tem apenas um agente C3.\r\n          </div>\r\n          <div>\r\n            Após alguns dias, as apostas válidas de B1 são 120000, as apostas\r\n            válidas de B2 são 40000, e as apostas válidas de B3 são 20000. As\r\n            apostas válidas de C1 são 100000, as apostas válidas de C2 são 30000\r\n            e as apostas válidas de C3 são 3000000, portanto, o desempenho total\r\n            de B1 é C1+C2=130000, e a taxa de bónus do agente é de 15/10000. B2\r\n            não tem agentes; portanto, o desempenho de B2 é 0. O desempenho\r\n            total de B3 é C3 - 3000000, por conseguinte, a taxa de bónus é de\r\n            15/10000. O desempenho total da Equipes direta de A é\r\n            180000+Subagente 3130000=3310000, pelo que a taxa de bónus é de\r\n            15/10000.\r\n          </div>\r\n          <div>Por conseguinte, o bónus é calculado da seguinte forma:</div>\r\n          <div>\r\n            <strong>1.

Outras Equipes:</strong> refere-se aos membros do\r\n            desenvolvimento de subordinados, subordinados, etc., que são\r\n            coletivamente chamados de outras Equipes; porque este sistema pode\r\n            desenvolver subordinados indefinidamente, para melhor compreensão,\r\n            este artigo apenas toma como exemplo uma estrutura de 2 níveis.\r\n          </div>\r\n          <div>\r\n            <strong>(1) De C1 e C2: </strong>Visto que o desempenho total de B1\r\n            é de 130000, tem apenas uma taxa de desconto de 15/10000, enquanto\r\n            que o desempenho total de A é de 3,31 milhões, e tem uma taxa de\r\n            desconto de 15/10000. Então a diferença de desconto entre A e B1 é\r\n            de: 15-15=0/10000, esta diferença é a parte contribuída por C1 e C2\r\n            para A, portanto\r\n            <strong> C1 e C2 contribuem para A: </strong> (100000+30000) ×\r\n            0/10000=<em>0</em>.\r\n          </div>\r\n          <div>\r\n            <strong>(2) De C3: </strong>Visto que B3 tem um desempenho total de\r\n            3 milhões e desfruta de uma taxa de desconto de 15/10000, enquanto A\r\n            tem um desempenho total de 3,31 milhões e também desfruta de uma\r\n            taxa de desconto de 15/10000, então a diferença entre o desconto de\r\n            A e B3 é de: 15-15=0/10000. <strong>C3 contribui para A: </strong>3\r\n            milhões x 0/10000=<em>0</em>.\r\n          </div>\r\n          <div><strong>3. Resumo:</strong></div>\r\n          <div>\r\n            (1)Devido ao poder de C3, todo o desempenho de A goza indiretamente\r\n            da taxa de desconto mais alta.\r\n          </div>\r\n          <div>\r\n            (2) B2 pode ser preguiçoso, e não tem vantagem se não houver\r\n            desenvolvimento de subordinados.\r\n          </div>\r\n          <div>\r\n            (3) Apesar de B3 se ter juntado relativamente tarde e pertencer aos\r\n            subordinados de A, o seu subordinado C3 é poderoso, permitindo que\r\n            B3 desfrute diretamente da mais alta taxa de desconto. Portanto,\r\n            independentemente da posição de B3 quando este se junta, os seus\r\n            benefícios nunca serão afetados, deixarão de sofrer as perdas de\r\n            outros subordinados, e o seu desenvolvimento não será restringido.\r\n          </div>\r\n          <div>\r\n            (4) Este é um modelo de agência absolutamente justo, e não\r\n            prejudicará
